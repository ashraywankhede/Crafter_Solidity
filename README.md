# Crafter_solidity
This course is about ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course . In that I got a Project/Challenge to create a mint and burn a token.

## Let's Initiate
I wrote the code in Solidity Language with the help of Metacrafters ETH Proof as my primary source of learning.

## Preface
In my project i have created a contract named as MyToken in that I used three variable : two strings and one uint (unsigned integer) where I have created my own token named "quantum" and token abbreviated as "ash". To record this token supply I also created a token totalsupply which I initially put it as a zero (0). To run this variables I mapped the address to uint and named as balances And for performed this task I created a MINT AND BURN FUNCTION.

### Project initiations

* I just used the Online Remix IDE for writing the solidity code.
* Then I created a file in this repository named solidity_project.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Project Deploy

* WE have to Create a new folder in remixIDE (Here i give a name as solidity_project.sol).
* We have to compile it.
* Once the code has been compiled, we need to deploy the contract in order to obtain the account address.
* Copy the account address and deploy it.
* The contract has been deployed without any issues.
* To create new tokens, select the "Mint" button and input the account address where the tokens should be added. Then, enter the desired token quantity (e.g., 250) and click "Transact" to complete the transaction.It add the tokens to the account.
* To verify the balance , we have to click at Run option after pasting the address.
*  To burn tokens, select the "Burn" button and input the account address where the tokens should be subtracted. Then, enter the desired token quantity (e.g., 100) and click "Transact" to complete the transaction.It add the tokens to the account.
* To verify the balance , we have to click again at Run option after pasting the address.
* This is all the steps I did in my project.
